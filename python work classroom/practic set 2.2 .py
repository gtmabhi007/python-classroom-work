## Q-7 To print the following patterns:

# #(i)
# for i in range(6):
#     for j in range(i):
#         print("*",end=" ")
#     print( )

#(ii)

# for i in range(6):
#     for j in range(i):
#         print(j+1,end=" ")
#     print( )

#(iii)

# for i in range(1, 6):
#     print(str(i) * i)

#(iv)

# print("0\n12\n345\n6789")

#(v)

# Loop from 1 to 4
# for i in range(1,6):
#     # Calculate spaces (5 - i)
#     spaces = " " * (6 - i)
    
#     # Generate numbers from 1 up to i, separated by spaces
#     numbers = " ".join(str(num) for num in range(1, i + 1))
    
#     # Print the combination
#     print(spaces + numbers)
